# This is a unit testing module

In this module i create a set of test cases for classes located [here](./src/main/java).

I use the junit4 and mockito dependencies to construct the tests. 

I also use TravisCI in order for the project to have continuous integration and jacoco plugin to examine the projects' code coverage.
